This git repository contains the code used to to evaluate the performance of different genomic prediction models to select parents in the early stage of a hybrid breeding program using predicted GCA.
The code is provided for reproducibility and further research.
The code was run with R 4.6.1 and AlphaSimR 1.10.0.

To run the code: 
  1) Run BURNIN.R
  2) In the DH Rapid Cycle folder, run GSDH.Model*_*.R -- select the model and scenario desired.

Results folder: contains the results of 100 runs for each model and scenario.
